meta-robot-opencv-demo
======================

A metadata layer for the Yocto Project (http://yoctoproject.org).

This layer provides an image recipe and necessary dependencies to run
the "MinnowBoard Fish Picker-Upper" demo. This demo makes use of a
modfified robotic arm (the OWI Robot Arm and its USB control module)
combined with a USB webcam. It makes use of the OpenCV computer vision
library to autonomously identify an object and pick it up. 

For a short overview of the demo setup and how it operates, check out
this video:

This has been used as a demo for the MinnowBoard (http://minnowboard.org).

This layer and the demo itself are works in progress. If you're trying to
make use of this layer and have questions, please don't hesitate to email
the maintainer (listed below) for further info. Further documentation
will be written ASAP.

License
=======

This layer is available under the MIT license. Most of the
additional recipes you'll find in the layer were taken from the
meta-openembedded repository. Special thanks to Kevin Strasser (an
intern with the Yocto Project at Intel's Open Source Technology
Center) for creating the wxwidgets and python-wxpython recipes,
which were non-trivial.
